BONERSTORM
=====================
A top-down 2d shooter made using pygame for a school assignment. Inspiration comes from a ![game](https://github.com/jahfer/bonestorm) that ![couple of](https://github.com/jahfer) ![friends](https://github.com/rbaylis91) and I made a couple years ago.

## Instructions
Run the game using
```
Python Bonerstorm.py
```

- Move using arrow/wasd keys, shoot using mouse.
- Each monster you kill will give you a heart
- Each monster that hits you will take away a heart
- Use up all your hearts, and YOU'RE DEAD
- Requires **![Python 2.7.8](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/)**, and **![pygame](http://www.pygame.org/)**
